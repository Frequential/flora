# Contributing to Flora
###### Right now we don't have a Code of Conduct, please follow common sense when talking to the community. We also don't have issue / pr templates but we're looking into that as I write this. 
Before committing a contribution, it's a good practice to create an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/JasperEdits/Flora/issues) or search if there's already one that is already being taken care of.
### Don't see an issue?
Then your change hasn't been proposed, create an issue, we'll see if the change is needed and at what priority, please check your issue is related to Flora and not to any of our [dependencies](https://github.com/JasperEdits/Flora/blob/master/pom.xml).
### Ready to make a change?
Exciting! Now it's time to fork the repository and start committing your own changes, you can do this via GitHub Desktop, CLI or using built-in features in an IDE.
- Make sure not to code meant for debugging or testing.
### PR
When you're done, open a pull request or PR.
- Self-check your PR.
- Flora developers will check your request.
- Make sure you're in touch with us in the process of making the PR, as we may have some questions.
### Merge time
If everything goes smoothly, your PR will get merged! Congratulations.
