# Privacy with Flora
###### Last updated and effective: June 10, 2021
Flora is an open source project that provides community enhancement features (the "Bot") by making use of Discord's API (the "API") and its service (the "Service(s)"). The Service is maintained by the Flora Development Team ("Flora", "us", "we") for users of the service ("you") and is aimed to help your Discord server (the "Guild", "Community") grow. This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from users of our Service.

### Information we keep
When you use our Bot and its Services you understand we may collect some essential information for the Service to work.

#### Information you directly provide
- Guild or user-specific settings and certain statistical data such as the date you first started using our Service.
#### Automatic collection
- The amount of messages sent in your Community since the Bot was added.

- Member information, such as username, ID, message count, of the members of your Community (if needed, meaning: if they interact within your Community).
### Where information is processed
The Service is located in Spain, hence information is processed in Spain, no matter where you or your Community are located (as we don't have access to that information)
### Our use of your information
We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. The information we keep, either be permanent or temporary is used to keep our Service running with the features we wish to offer. The information provided to our Services is only kept by us and not shared with any other third party.

### Data retention
Information is kept for as long as its useful and provides a purpose.
### Security
We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
### Links to other websites
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

### Your control over your information
We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users, regardless of their location.

Individuals in California, the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.

#### How do I access information you keep about me?
If you would like to know which information we keep on our Service, you can contact us directly via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PkcFvftMBu). Contact with any member of our team for further instructions.
#### How do I correct, update, amend, or delete the personal data you have about me?
Via the use of our Service you are able to modify your information. If that is not the case, we can personally modify the information you are requesting to change. To do so, contact us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PkcFvftMBu).
#### How do I restrict you from processing my personal data?
We do not control when we start or stop processing data you provide. If you don't want us to process information about you or your Community, stop using the Service.
